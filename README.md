<B>Overview</B>
The Resume Scanner Web App is a machine learning-based solution that classifies resumes into specific job categories. By analyzing the text within resumes, the app can determine the most likely profession of the applicant, ranging from data science to civil engineering. This web app makes use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques to classify resumes into their appropriate job roles.

Features
Automated Resume Classification: Automatically categorize resumes into pre-defined categories.
Real-time Analysis: Upload and scan resumes in real-time using the trained model.
Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess raw resume text to optimize classification accuracy.
Machine Learning: Utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with One-vs-Rest classification for job prediction.
Transferable: Easily adaptable to new data and categories.
Dataset
The app uses the UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv dataset for training and testing the machine learning model. The dataset contains resume text and corresponding job categories.
